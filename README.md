## Installation

Must have node js and the packages needed installed on your system.

## Contributing

Any contributions are welcome!

## Tests

You can use postman to run tests on the routes. I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) in my situation. If you do a git clone, type npm i on the terminal and then nodemon server.js. The server will deploy and run the application.
